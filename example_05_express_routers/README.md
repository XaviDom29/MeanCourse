#express.Router

The express.Router class can be used to create modular routing handlers.

Imagine a complex app, where you have dozens of API endpoints to handle. It makes sense to separate it into different files, adding more structure to our API.

With this way, it's easier to organize different endpoints of the API.

Note how users.js define all the routes, in a express.Router() class, and then it's exported to use within server.js
