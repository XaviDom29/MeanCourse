#AngularJS 'Hello World'
In this example, we are going to see an introduction to angularJS and the most basic directives.

##What is a directive?
Further in the course directives will be explained in more detail, this is an introduction to understand the basic directives of angular.
A directive is used inside html to customize it. A directive could be:
- An html tag.
- An attribute.
- A class (Alghough not recommended, it causes confusion with CSS).
- A comment.

####The directives of this example are:
* **ng-app**: Directive to
* **ng-init**: initialize a variable to a value.
* **ng-bind**: The value of the tag will be bounded to. (Same as the brackets '{{ }}').
* **ng-model**: The value of this field will be binded to variable * ng-model (Usually used in forms).
* **ng-repeat**: To iterate over a list of elements generating this html for each one.
